Problem 1: 
How to run:
1. Open a terminal window.
2. Go to the folder where the files are saved. For example  cd Downloads
3. Type the command:py snowfall.py < snowfall_input1.txt
4. The console will print one of the following:
   <input> solution: YES or<input> solution: NO

Heart of the algorithm:
The program reads the number of days and a list of snowfall values. 
It checks if the total snowfall of any three consecutive days 
is greater than half of the total snowfall for all days. 
If this happens, it prints “solution: YES”. 
Otherwise, it prints “solution: NO”.
Problem 2: Pandemic
How to run:
1. Open a terminal window.
2. Go to the folder where the files are saved. For example:   cd Downloads
3. Type the command:  py pandemic.py < pandemic_input1.txt
4. The console will print one of the following:There are healthy counties left or
   There are no healthy counties left

Heart of the algorithm:
The program reads the size of a square grid and the positions of the infected counties. 
A healthy county becomes infected if two or more of its four neighbors 
are infected. The program repeats this process until no new infections happen. In the end, it checks the grid and prints whether there are still any healthy counties.
Problem 3
How to run:
1. Open a terminal window and go to the folder containing this file.
2. Type: py shopping_cart.py < shopping_input1.txt
3. The console will print the result, for example:  4 items were selected

Heart of the algorithm:
The program uses a sliding window method to find the longest sequence of aisles that contains at most two unique item categories. 
When a third category appears, the window is moved forward until only two remain. The variable “max_items” keeps track of the longest valid sequence.

Problem 4
How to run:
1. Open a terminal window.
2. Go to the folder where your files are saved. For example:cd Downloads
3. Type the command: py symbol_puzzle.py < spg_input1.txt
4. The console will print either:   The board is valid orThe board is invalid

Heart of the algorithm:
The program uses a simple validation algorithm to check whether the n×n symbol board is valid. 
It checks every cell on the board to make sure no symbol appears more than once in the same row, column, or √n × √n box. If all cells follow these three rules, the board is considered valid and the program prints “The board is valid”. Otherwise, it prints “The board is invalid”.

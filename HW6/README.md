Problem 1: In this problem, I implemented Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Insertion sort adds each number to the correct position and works well for small inputs. Merge sort splits the list into smaller parts and then merges them in order, and quick sort sorts the list by choosing a pivot. The input files for this problem were created by me and include small, medium, and large datasets. To run this program, type python 526HW6 Q1(1).py in the terminal, choose the input size, and then choose the sorting algorithm. The program prints the original numbers and the sorted result.
Problem 2: In this problem, I implemented Radix Sort using the least significant digit method. The algorithm sorts numbers digit by digit and works well for larger datasets. The input files for this problem were also created by me and include small, medium, and large datasets. To run this program, type python 526HW6 Q2.py in the terminal. The program reads the input files and prints the original numbers and the sorted output.
Problem 3: In this problem, I implemented the Gale–Shapley stable matching algorithm. Each man proposes to women based on his preference list, and each woman keeps the best proposal she receives. This continues until everyone is matched, and the result is a stable matching. The input files for this problem were provided by the instructor. To run this program, type python 526HW6 Q3.py in the terminal. The program reads the input files and prints sample inputs and the matching results.

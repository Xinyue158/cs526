Homework 3
Problem 1
The program reads a text file named palendrome_0.txt, where each line contains one word. It checks whether each word is a palindrome and writes “true” or “false” to output.txt. At the end, it records the total number of palindromic words.
To test the program, provide a valid input file named palendrome_0.txt in the same folder. 

Problem 2 
This part generates all unique substrings of a given string, such as "abcab", using recursion. It stores non-repeating substrings in a set and prints them along with the total count. The solution demonstrates how recursive exploration can efficiently enumerate unique string segments.

Problem 3 
The program shows three recursive methods for reversing a stack: array-based, singly linked list, and doubly linked list. Using integers from 1 to 10, it outputs the reversed sequence from 10 to 1. This illustrates recursion’s ability to manipulate different data structures without additional storage.

Problem 4 
This program reads pairs of Ghostbuster (B) and Ghost (G) coordinates from an input file named ghostbusters_input_0.txt. It checks whether any of the beams between pairs intersect by applying geometric orientation and line-segment intersection tests.
To run the program, include a valid ghostbusters_input_0.txt file 。
The program prints either “All Ghosts: were eliminated” or “All Ghosts: were not eliminated,” depending on whether any beams cross.

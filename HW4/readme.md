HW4 
Problem 1
This part runs automatically without any input file. It builds the tree structure in the code and prints the three differelt traversal results directly.

Problem 2
This part reads data from a file named fewest_1.txt.
Make sure this file is in the same directory as the Python script before running the program.
The file should contain three lines: the number of elements, the target value, and the list of numbers separated by spaces.
The result (the smallest number of elements whose sum exceeds the target) will appear on the screen after execution.

Problem 3
This part reads coordinate data from a file named righttangles_1.txt.
The file should contain the total number of points on the first line, followed by one point per line (x and y coordinates separated by a space).

Files:
fewest_1.txt
righttangles_1.txt

flood.py simulates how water builds up over time because of cracks. Each crack appears at a certain time and lets water flow in. At every time step, the program fixes one crack and also removes some water by drainage. The water level is updated step by step, and the program checks whether it reaches a dangerous limit. The output shows whether a flood happens, and if not, the highest water level reached. The program is tested using multiple flood input files.
ski.py finds the longest downhill ski path on a mountain grid. From each position, the skier can move in eight directions, but only to a lower height. The program uses a search method with memory to avoid repeating the same work. It checks all possible starting points and prints the maximum number of steps that can be taken downhill. The program is tested using three different ski input files.

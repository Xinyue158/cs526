Problem 1 I implemented a simple Binary Search Tree .I made a Node class and a BST class, and then added the four functions: add, delete, find, and print. To show how everything works, I let the program randomly generate some numbers, insert them into the tree, and then print the initial tree. After that, I tested addNode, deleteNode, and findNode one by one, and printed the tree after each operation. The printTree() function uses an in-order traversal. To run this part, you just run the BST code or the Jupyter cell, and the printed output will include the input list, the initial tree, and the results after each operation.
Problem 2 I used dynamic programming to count how many vowel-only Morse code interpretations a dot-dash string can have. I only used the Morse codes for A, E, I, O, and U, and checked all possible endings of length 1, 2, or 3. The program reads vowel_input1.txt through vowel_input4.txt and uses the last line of each file as the Morse string. It then prints the number of valid combinations. To run this part, just put the four files next to the code and execute the script. It will automatically print the output in the format the homework asks for.
Problem 3 I computed the longest alternating increasing sequence formed by mixing numbers from A and B. I used two DP arrays: one for the best sequence ending at some A[i] and another for the best sequence ending at some B[j]. Then I stored predecessor information so I could reconstruct the final sequence later. The code reads longest_seq1.txt through longest_seq6.txt and prints the longest alternating increasing sequence for each file. Running this part is the same as the others: once the files are in the same directory, just run the script and it will print everything.
